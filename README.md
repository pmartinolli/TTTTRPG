# TTTTRPG
**Timeline Tree of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, celebrating more than 40 years of game design innovations**


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/207627479.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/207627479)

Over 1000 ttrpg and 800 game designs, webbed through 1500 links. From 1974 to 2020.

* Download the **[PDF poster](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/ttttrpg.pdf)** (4 Mo) (or the [condensed version](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/ttttrpg-condensed.pdf) without the innovations)

## Long term goal

This timeline is a part of the « [On the Shoulders of Cloud Giants](http://zotrpg.blogspot.com/search/label/on%20the%20shoulders%20of%20dwarves) » [(en français)](https://jdr.hypotheses.org/category/sur-epaules-geants-nuages) set of projects. See also a [Timeline Tree of Games and Board Games](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTGBG).

Another quantitative project of this set is « [On the Shoulders of Cloud Giants: citation practices in the tabletop role-playing game publishing industry](https://github.com/pmartinolli/OtSoCG) ».

I would like to work on the taxonomy of relations between published TTRPGs and this project is a first draft and essay. My ambition is to design a whole phylomemetic system to track evolution of cultural ideas. I will use the TTRPG published products as subject because it is offering a clear, defined and accessible set of items.

## How to... 

### ... Do it myself 

* Download the latest [source code](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/ttttrpg.gv). It should be easy to understand, but you can read more [explanations](https://jdr.hypotheses.org/919) of the structure of the source code. 
* Download the [zip package of icon pictures](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N30n0QYaGSWLJTzJwPzn3wuklmib3zI8). Unpack the pictures in a folder C:/gv/ on your computer.
* Install and set up [Graphviz and Textpad++](http://zotrpg.blogspot.com/2016/05/creating-graph-for-od.html).
* Compile the code. The details are in the header of the [source code](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/ttttrpg.gv) ("Parameters"). It will produce a ps file.
* With Adobe Distiller, turn the ps file into a PDF file. If you successfully used a free and open-source software to do that job, please let me know. 

### ... Contribute

* Send me corrections or suggestions at pascal.umontreal [at] gmail.com 
  * It can take time before I answer you.
  * If you don't want to be cited as contributor, add "no citation" in your email.

* Help me to compile the `dot` source code graph to produce a more dense graph.

* Improve [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) items related to tabletop RPG. 
  * I documented some guidelines here https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Board_Games (contact me at [Pmartinolli](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Pmartinolli) if you need help). I already made 7000 edits on TTRPGs so I have a little understanding of what is what there.
  * Why Wikidata ? I try to mirror as much of the informations as I can on Wikidata to benefit from the database tools and from the community of contributors. [Click here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Pmartinolli) to produce a graph of the citation practices in TTRPG. 
  
* Export the data into [GEPHY](https://gephi.org/). Why ? 1) I want to try it ; 2) I think the database structure of GEPHY can help managing all the informations ; 3) It's open source.

### ... Start my own project

* Have a look on this simple [template](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/template.gv) of the graph, and on the [rendering](https://github.com/pmartinolli/TTTTRPG/blob/master/files/template.png).
* Gather your friends (or your students) and decide some teamwork methods. Each of you create an account on GitHub. 
* Deposit your files on GitHub.
* Go!
* Don't forget to be a gentleman/gentlelady of the open access : cite me and Todd Lehman.

## Short term improvements

- Produce a more dense graph.
- Insert a key legend to explicit the colors and links displayed.
- Draw different kind of lines for better understanding of links.
- Use sans-serif font for better readability.
- Change the font/color/background of the name of items with a cover picture for better readability.
